  For my final project I would like to design and implement a security system with full
  functionality. I will use a motion sensor, microphone and photoresistor in order to detect in 
  multiple forms. For the microphone in particular, a high pass filter will be implemented to detect 
  high pitch noises such as glass breaking. Once one of sensors detects something, an alarm will go 
  off using a speaker and LEDs will begin to flash. Once an alarm has been triggered, the user has 
  three attempts to input the correct passcode into a keypad. An LCD will display all of the button 
  that are being pressed. If the user is not able to correctly input the passcode, then red and blue 
  LEDs will begin to flash and spin on a motor to indicate that the police have been alerted. The police 
  functionality will be implemented using SPI connection to a second processor.
